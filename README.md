# FilmFinder üçø
Film Finder is a minimal and easy-to-use application that allows users to search movies and view details about a specific movie. The app also allows users to browse movies based on a specific genre by using the drop down menu in the main screen. Once a movie has been selected, users will be re-directed to view details on that specific movie. The goal of the app was to practice working with a third party API, hone my API integration skills, and hone my skills in React by building a fun web application. Film Finder leverages React to build the user interface using components and to make the app modular, React Router to create seamless screen flows throughout application, CSS to style the user interface, and the MovieDB API to search movie details and display movie details.
